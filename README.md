- 👋 Hi, I’m Andy
- 🌱 I’m currently studying networking with a bit of programming thrown in.
- 👀 Turns out I quite like the programming part so i've started making lil projects and tools for my own use and to reinforce some of the concepts i've been learning.
- 💞️ Please feel free to offer any feedback on my hacked together code. Constructive input and ideas are always welcome.
- 📫 Hit me up at nerpusterra@gmail.com ...
